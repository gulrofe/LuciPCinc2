The tool used for construct the LuciPcinc2 was the MIT App Inventor produced by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The mission of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship. 

The MIT App Inventor [https://appinventor.mit.edu/] is an intuitive, visual programming environment that allows everyone – even children – to build fully functional apps for Android phones, iPhones, and Android/iOS tablets. Those new to MIT App Inventor can have a simple first app up and running in less than 30 minutes. And what's more, our blocks-based tool facilitates the creation of complex, high-impact apps in significantly less time than traditional programming environments. The MIT App Inventor project seeks to democratize software development by empowering all people, especially young people, to move from technology consumption to technology creation.

A small team of MIT CSAIL staff and students, led by Professor Hal Abelson, forms the nucleus of an international movement of inventors. In addition to leading educational outreach around MIT App Inventor and conducting research on its impacts, this core team maintains the free online app development environment that serves more than 6 million registered users.

Blocks-based coding programs inspire intellectual and creative empowerment. MIT App Inventor goes beyond this to provide real empowerment for kids to make a difference – a way to achieve social impact of immeasurable value to their communities. In fact, App Inventors in school and outside of traditional educational settings have come together and done just that. [http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/library]
