The measurement of pH, oxygen tension (pO2), and oxygen saturation (SO2) from venous blood is usefull for detect hemoglobin with an altered affinity for oxygen. The P50 is a partial pressure of oxygen at which the hemoglobina is 50% saturated with oxygen. Therefore, the P50 calculation, using the three variables cited above, can provide informations about hemoglobins with low or high binding affinities for oxygen.
